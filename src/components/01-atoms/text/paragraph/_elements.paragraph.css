/**
 * If you set your lines too long, your reader will have difficulty in following 
 * from one line to the next; they may mistakenly skip lines or reread the same
 * line. Set your measure too short and your reader’s eyes will have to change 
 * direction too frequently, resulting in tired eyes and a reading experience 
 * that feels like hard work, however engaging the text.
 * The often quoted ideal length for a line is 66 characters, with a range of
 * 45-75 characters (including spaces) generally considered satisfacrory.
